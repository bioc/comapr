Description: comapr detects crossover intervals for single cells from their 
    haplotype states matrices. The genetic distances can then be calculated via 
    the mapping functions for the list of SNP intervals. Visualisation functions for 
    plotting interval-based genetic map or cumulative genetic distances are 
    implemented, which help reveal the variation of crossovers landscape across 
    the genome and across individuals.
